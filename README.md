# Welcome to My Bouncing Box
This task seeks to show the animation of a box that bounces diagonally across the screen.

## Task
The objective is to animate a `div` element to move diagonally within the browser window. The animation should reflect a bouncing effect, with the box changing direction each time it reaches the window's borders.
## Description
This project features a dynamic animation of a box that bounces diagonally across the screen. The box's movement is constrained by the window's dimensions, causing it to reverse direction upon colliding with the edges.
## Installation
Well, I dont think this needs any form of installation as it runs directly on the browser.
## Usage
In order to use this, you need to:
- Save the HTML code into a file which you will have to name `index.html`.
- Next you will have to open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Observe the blue box as it carries out that which is written in my description
